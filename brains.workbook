Brains - An Introduction to Logic
Chapter 1: Data:
i - We produce data rapidly, so here is a detailed guide on other data.
We express, convey, decrease, and implement data. In other words, we DICE. DICE stands for decrease, implement, convey, and express. We break up the data we have learned and then implement a plan to convey it. Then we express our feelings about this knowledge, which is the standard data plot. But we can use other data plots to record and share data. "When one person shares, two people learn" is a quote. This quote implies that sharing recent knowledge is important and allows us to use different data plot mechanisms. We have other data plots, which is good news, but we can imply that we are not used to all of them precisely, but as we are processing data rapidly (at approximately 402 km/h), we have to use them fast, but that also does not have to imply that we have to use them, although we do need to conduct fundamental beliefs in these data plotting algorithms. We just need to use them precisely, but not a full score type of precise, just an average precise, like a 99 or 98 out of a total of 100 marks. We can summarize in conclusion, we find that approximately a lot out of the 7.2 billion people in 2024 have used this method for decision-making and are not in a lot of trouble, but in trouble. They have not much to do with it and that is final in the explanation of how you should manage data.
Chapter 2: Decisions, decisions:
You have probably made a lot of decisions in your life and the whole curriculum has implied in cases such as "What should I eat for breakfast; cereal or toast," and you can have chosen cereal or toast, and you are a homosapien, so technically, our ancestors long ago who lived before us had to make decisions a lot on what to eat; a zebra or a buffalo in other terms. They had chosen, so they had survived as they had not starved to death. We can do things like our ancestors and we have decision-making inherited from our parents because homosapiens and neanderthals had decision-making to learn how exactly to survive and that we should all have decision-making in our blood. But, imagine if we just did not have a lot of decision-making skills, we would not have to imagine at all because we would have to imply laws of physics to say that we cannot decide fast at all because of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, we can state that we have 1 possibility; that it will be blank. How exactly, is it that our neurons in our brain go at approximately 402 km/h, and if we were very fast at decision making, we would have to apply the e = mc2 formula and find the speed of light, which is a constant in this algebraic formula, and this formula is stating that in our formula, the constant rate of c is equal to 29,97,92,458 m/s, which can imply that our brains cannot think as fast as the speed of light, considering that the world record for the fastest decision making goes to nobody, but everybody can assume of fast decision making and compare it to them, but the problem is, that if you really want to be the fastest decision maker, then just simply quit trying to be. Because of light, we can find that the probability of getting to be the fastest is P(fastest decision maker) = 1/0 = 0%. There are zero possible outcomes because we can evaluate by imagining a light. That light is worth nothing so that light cannot be compared, but same as you; we are the bane of Earth's society, so we are worth nothing, too. Zero possible outcomes, one favorable one, 1 / 0 = undefined, round to zero (no value in common), so a zero percent probability occurs. So in conclusion, we can be decision-makers, just not very good ones.
Chapter 3: Knowledge:
Nobody can be the smartest, here is an explanation of how exactly. First, if you were to be the smartest, calculate the probability of that. Here is the solution. P(smartest) = 1/0 = 0, how is it zero possible outcomes? It becomes zero because everything on Earth is worthless. That implies that the few decades you have been living were worthless. So we have zero possibilities, and 1 desirable outcome, and 1 / 0 = x / 100 => x = (100 * 1) / 0 => x = undefined, round to zero and we get a no possible outcome you are the smartest.
Chapter 4: Don't Believe Morals:
In classic wit literature, there are a few morals, for example, Panchatantra morals. "Common sense is always superior to literal knowledge." This has the intention that karma can come for you if you do not use common sense, as in the tale of The Bramins and The Lion, where it is that there once were 4 twins. 3 of those twins were educated. Those three twins found a dead lion. They wanted to revive it. But the fourth twin had asked a favor. "Before you revive the lion, could I please climb this tree first," asked the fourth twin. They allowed him to and then the three brahmins had revived the lion. But the lion was hungry, so it was targeting the three Brahmins. Then, the three twins died together, and after the lion ran away to consume the three educated twins, the fourth twin ran as fast as he could to his village. Finally, he announced that the three other twins died. This has the intention of imploring kids to just use common sense the majority of the time. For example, if a kid uses 48% common sense, that is not suitable. But if a kid uses common sense 89% of the time, that will be allowed. This makes no sense as i common sense was a thing common by homosapiens, that would mean common sense is worthless because that we are worthless. It's also that it is a solution, but solutions make people suffer, so technically, that may imply common sense. Thus, we imply that we cannot believe in morals.
Chapter 5: Establish Strong Beliefs:
If we do, we can just accept everything and we will not have to suffer so much trying to establish a strong and final conclusion that all of the gang has to agree and fundamentally don't brute force change any part of the deal, even if it is just a single letter.
Conclusion: Just don't do whatever you want! Just think about the consequences!
